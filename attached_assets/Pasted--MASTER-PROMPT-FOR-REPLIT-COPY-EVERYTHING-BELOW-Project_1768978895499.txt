Project Title

AI-Based Personalized Study Plan Generator using Syllabus Analysis and LLM-Driven Familiarity Assessment

Project Overview

Build a full-stack web application that automatically generates a personalized study timetable for a student based on their uploaded syllabus, initial familiarity with the subject, available study time, and exam deadline.

The system must not rely on manual admin intervention, must be scalable, and must use LLMs only for question generation, not for decision-making logic.

The project is intended for a B.Tech CSE major project and journal publication, so all logic must be explainable, rule-based, and realistic.

High-Level Workflow

Student registers/logs in

Student uploads syllabus (PDF or image)

System extracts text using OCR

NLP extracts subject, topics, and subtopics

System generates syllabus-specific MCQs using an LLM

Student takes a short familiarity test

System classifies learner as Slow / Medium / Fast

System analyzes topic difficulty

System generates a personalized, day-wise study plan

System adapts the plan based on student progress

Technology Stack (Mandatory)

Backend: Python + FastAPI

Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL

Frontend: React (preferred) or basic HTML/CSS

OCR: Tesseract or EasyOCR

NLP: spaCy / regex-based parsing

AI: LLM API (ChatGPT or Gemini) — ONLY for MCQ generation

Authentication: JWT or session-based

Module-Wise Detailed Requirements
MODULE 1: User Management

Student registration & login

Store:

Name

Email

Academic level

Secure authentication

Database tables:

users

user_profiles

MODULE 2: Syllabus Upload & Text Extraction

Input:

PDF or image syllabus

Process:

Detect file type

Extract text:

PDF → pdfplumber / PyMuPDF

Image → OCR

Output:

Cleaned syllabus text

Store:

Raw text

Processed text

MODULE 3: Topic & Subject Extraction (NLP)

From extracted text:

Detect subject domain (Maths, DBMS, DSA, OS, etc.)

Extract:

Units

Topics

Subtopics

Use:

Regex for “Unit”, “Module”

Keyword matching

Noun phrase extraction

Output example:

{
  "subject": "DBMS",
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "Normalization",
      "subtopics": ["1NF", "2NF", "3NF"]
    },
    {
      "name": "ER Diagrams",
      "subtopics": []
    }
  ]
}

MODULE 4: Topic Difficulty Classification

Each topic must be classified as Easy / Medium / Hard using rule-based logic.

Rules example:

More than 2 subtopics → Hard

Keywords like “algorithm”, “normalization”, “optimization” → Hard

Definition-based topics → Easy

Important:
❌ Do NOT use ML
❌ Do NOT claim intelligence

MODULE 5: LLM-Based Familiarity Test (Core Feature)

Use an LLM to dynamically generate syllabus-specific MCQs.

Prompt logic:

Input extracted topics

Request:

8–12 MCQs

4 options each

Correct answer

Beginner level

Output strictly in JSON

LLM role:
✔ Question generation only
❌ No evaluation logic

Purpose:

Estimate syllabus familiarity, not intelligence

MODULE 6: Familiarity Test Execution & Learner Classification

Display MCQs instantly

Measure:

Score

Time taken

Classification rules:

< 40% → Slow learner

40–70% → Medium learner

70% → Fast learner

Store learner profile.

MODULE 7: Personalization Factors

Use ONLY these factors:

Learner pace (slow/medium/fast)

Topic difficulty

Available study hours per day

Exam deadline

Student task completion behavior (after plan starts)

❌ No psychological profiling
❌ No IQ / cognitive claims

MODULE 8: Study Plan Generation Algorithm
Base Time Allocation:

Easy → 1 hour

Medium → 2 hours

Hard → 3 hours

Pace Multiplier:

Slow → 1.5

Medium → 1.0

Fast → 0.75

Formula:

Adjusted Time = Base Time × Pace Multiplier

Scheduling Rules:

Do not exceed daily study hours

Do not schedule multiple hard topics in one day for slow learners

Break large topics across days

Insert revision after hard topics

Add weekly revision buffer

Output:

Day-wise timetable:

{
  "Day 1": ["Normalization (1NF)"],
  "Day 2": ["Normalization (2NF)"],
  "Day 3": ["Revision"],
  "Day 4": ["ER Diagram"]
}

MODULE 9: Adaptive Update Engine

Track:

Task completion

Delays

Early finishes

Rules:

Early completion for 3 days → increase pace

Missed tasks for 2 days → reduce load

Regenerate plan dynamically.

Constraints & Ethics (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do NOT claim psychological evaluation

Do NOT claim perfect accuracy

Do NOT use deep ML models

Clearly state limitations

LLM output is used only for familiarity estimation

Expected Features Summary

✔ Fully automated
✔ Scalable
✔ Personalized
✔ Explainable
✔ Journal-safe
✔ B.Tech feasible
